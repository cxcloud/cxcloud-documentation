# Welcome to CXCloud

Welcome to CX Cloud. This site will help you through the journey of setting up and operating a CX Cloud project.

## What is CX Cloud?

CX Cloud is an idea for creating micro-services based architecture on AWS Cloud. This project is created and maintained by Tieto's CEM unit in Finland. We use this idea, architecture and 3rd party tools \(e.g. commercetools, Algolia, Contentful\) for creating high quality online services for our customers. For some diagrams, see CX Cloud [architecture](https://docs.cxcloud.com/architecture). More information about the concept can be found from [cxcloud.com](https://cxcloud.com).
