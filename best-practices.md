## Multivendor API development

The CX Cloud enables a way to do API development with multiple vendors
where each vendor has only access to the API they are managing. There are
two best practises described here: one for situation where all development is
done in a single AWS account and second where vendors are developing in their
own AWS accounts and APIs are managed in a central core AWS account. The second way
offers proper separation of concerns and will allow vendors to only change
resources related to their own API development. It also allows for a parallel
deployment cycle and faster lead time for changes to production.
