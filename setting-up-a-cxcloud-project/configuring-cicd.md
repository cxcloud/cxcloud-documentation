# Configuring CI/CD pipeline

When using CX Cloud CLI, it is fairly easy for one to both create and then deploy CX Cloud infra, selected services and demo frontends to AWS. This is typically enough for testing and exploration needs.

But when preparing for customer project development phase, creating a CI/CD pipeline between your Github \(or the Git host of your choice eg. Bitbucket\) and various environments in AWS \(or selected cloud provider eg. Azure\) is the next thing to do. As this area can be very dependent on customer preferences and existing set up, you probably will customize your pipeline. Regardless, we have created this basic set up.
