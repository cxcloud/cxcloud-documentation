# Managing your infra and Kubernetes

With CX Cloud CLI, you can set-up your Kubernetes cluster and then move forward with services and frontend's.

But to manage your infra and Kubernetes cluster, there are a couple of tools you can use. Essentially CX Cloud CLI, [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops) and [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) . There is no "one tool to manage everything" but use case specific, widely used tools.

## Tools to manage your CX Cloud infra
