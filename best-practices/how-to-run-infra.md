# Managing your infra and Kubernetes

With CX Cloud CLI, you can set-up your Kubernetes cluster and then move forward with services and frontend's.

But to manage your infra and Kubernetes cluster, there are a couple of tools you can use. Essentially CX Cloud CLI, [Kops](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops), [Kubernetes Dashboard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-application-cluster/web-ui-dashboard/), [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/) and [AWS Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/). There is no "one tool to manage everything" but use case specific, widely used tools.
