# How to participate?

CX Cloud is developed further also via customer projects. As an example, in one case a simple IAM \(identity and access management\) solution was needed, so the project team developed a service for AWS Cognito. This was then taken as a core module to CX Cloud and today via CLI anyone can generate a Cognito powered Auth-service to their CX Cloud project.
