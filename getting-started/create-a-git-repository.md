# Git Repository Conventions

While CX Cloud CLI generates the project and infrastructure code for you, you need to create the repositories on Github \(or the Git host of your choice eg. Bitbucket\).

For example, if you want to create a simple search API, create a repository on Github named `service-search`. It is recommended to follow the following conventions when naming repositories:

* Infrastructure code: `infra`
* Microservices and API: `service-NAME` \(eg. `service-content`\)
* Serverless functions: `function-NAME` \(eg. `function-emails`\)
* Frontend/UI code: `ui-NAME` \(eg. `ui-webshop`\)

Now that you have your environment ready, it's time for bootstrapping the infrastructure on AWS.
