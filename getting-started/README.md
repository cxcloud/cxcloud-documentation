# Requirements

Before you set up a CX Cloud project, you need to prepare your environment and configure the tools needed for the process.

Please start by [preparing your environment](prepare-your-environment.md) and then move forward installing [CX Cloud CLI](install-cxcloud-cli.md). <!--For convenience, We also provide some guidance for [Git repository conventions](create-a-git-repository.md). -->
